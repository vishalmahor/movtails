click the movie on which you get the datails and just below the search bar you can sear the deatls of the movie like the name, rating, year, cast image etc.
you can also add these movie in your playlist but for that you have to login by click on the "my account" link in the header section. 
once you get login search for the movie and scroll down so you can find the check box of public and private select any one and click on the "add to playlist" button.
